- 0D model.ipynb contains the code for the original 0D model using the parameters found in literature and contained in the file Parameters.xlsx

- 0D model_extended.ipynb 0D model with some other trials studied

- Run of the model for the average quantities.ipynb it's the 0D model adapted to be runned for the samples generated from SAFE. This
code saves the values of the c_t and SF for ever instant and every sample in two files 

- QOI extraction 0D.ipynb extraction of the QOIs for the 0D model obtained from the output numpy array of Run of the model for the average quantities.ipynb

- matrix generator for Morris MATLAB.ipynb creates the matrices used in the SAFE toolbox of matlab for the sensitivity analysis. It tooks
the range contained in the file Ranges.xlsx

- QOIs extraction 3D.ipynb extraction of the QOIs for the 3D model from the snapshots

- minmax 3D.ipynb extraxction of the minimum and maximum for the 3D modedel from the snapshots

- Sensitiity analysis for D.ipynb sensitivity analysis on the diffusion coefficient
